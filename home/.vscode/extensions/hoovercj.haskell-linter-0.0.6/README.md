# README
## Overview
"haskell-linter" is a wrapper for [hlint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/). It highlights hlint warnings and errors inline and provides a code-action to accept hlint suggestions.

## Dependencies
It expects a version of hlint >= 1.9.1 to be installed and already added to the path. If it is installed but cannot be found, add the path to your preferences as seen below.

```json
{
	"haskell.hlint.executablePath": "Path\To\Executable"
}
```

## Configuration:
There are various options that can be configured by making changes to your user or workspace preferences.

### Lint onType or onSave
By default the linter will lint as you type. Alternatively, set `haskell.hlint.run` to `onSave` or `never` if you want to lint only when the file is saved (works best if auto-save is on) or disable it for a workspace or entirely. 

```json
{
	"haskell.hlint.run": "onType" // also: "onSave", "never"
}
```

### Hints
By default the linter simply calls the `hlint` command without arguments. To specify a set of hints to use or a set of hints to ignore, add them to the configuration as shown below. 
 
```json
{
	"haskell.hlint.hints": ["Default", "Dollar", "Generalise"],
    "haskell.hlint.ignore": ["Redundant do"]
}
```

### Troubleshooting
Make sure you have a hlint installed and that the version is 1.9.1 or newer. If you're having issues with the extension, set the logLevel setting to `log` and check the output in the developer tools console.

```json
{
    "haskell.hlint.logLevel": "log"
}
```

## Acknowledgements
The extension architecture is based off of the PHPValidationProvider from the built-in [php extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/php).
